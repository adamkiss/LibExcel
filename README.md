# Excel for ProcessWire v0.0.0

This is a ProcessWire wrapper for the [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel). In addition to including the PHPExcel, it also includes few functions for generating very simple excel tables (think: outputting a two dimensional array into excel file).

## Usage

``` php
  // example: usage from other modules
  $excel = $this->modules->get('LibraryExcel'); 
  
  // â€¦your code, $excel is now your new PHPExcel document

  // alternatively, switch to simple mode
  $excel->set_simple_mode();
```
